<abstract>This map layer portrays 2004-2008 per capita personal income, annual number of full-time and part-time jobs, average wage per job in dollars, population, and per capita number of jobs, for counties in the United States.

Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation.

The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners.  The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included.  Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included.

Average wage per job is the total wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county.  Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses;and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants.  It reflects the amount of payments disbursed,but not necessarily earned during the year.

Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation.

All dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.The information in this map layer comes from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS) that is distributed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov/.</abstract>
<purpose>These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.</purpose>

<procdesc>Boundaries for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the water
        bodies were deleted from ATLAS-CNTY.  Using information from the file
        ECONLIST.PRN on BEA-REA2008 the following counties and cities in
        Virginia were merged:
        &gt; Albemarle County and Charlottesville
        &gt; Alleghany County, Clifton Forge, and Covington
        &gt; Augusta County, Staunton, and Waynesboro
        &gt; Bedford County and Bedford city
        &gt; Campbell County and Lynchburg
        &gt; Carroll County and Galax
        &gt; Dinwiddie County, Colonial Heights, and Petersburg
        &gt; Fairfax County, Fairfax City, and Falls Church
        &gt; Frederick County and Winchester
        &gt; Greensville County and Emporia
        &gt; Henry County and Martinsville
        &gt; James City County and Williamsburg
        &gt; Montgomery County and Radford
        &gt; Pittsylvania County and Danville
        &gt; Prince George County and Hopewell
        &gt; Prince William County, Manassas, and Manassas Park
        &gt; Roanoke County and Salem
        &gt; Rockbridge County, Buena Vista, and Lexington
        &gt; Rockingham County and Harrisonburg
        &gt; Southampton County and Franklin
        &gt; Spotsylvania County and Fredericksburg
        &gt; Washington County and Bristol
        &gt; Wise County and Norton
        &gt; York County and Poquoson

        From BEA-REA2008, the files containing total personal income, per
        capita personal income, annual number of full-time and part-time jobs,
        and average wage per job information (ca13.dfx and ca34.dfx) were
        downloaded as an Excel file and joined to the edited ATLAS-CNTY map
        layer in ArcMap.  The resulting file was saved as a geopackage.</procdesc>
