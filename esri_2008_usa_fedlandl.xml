<descript>
<abstract>United States Federal Land (line) is a polyline theme representing the linear federally owned land features (for example, national parkways and wild and scenic rivers) of the United States.  Attribute information includes the name, type and length of the features.

This dataset is from the 2008 ESRI Data &amp; Maps Collection.</abstract>
<purpose>United States Federal Land (line) provides the linear federally owned land features for geographic display and analysis at regional and national levels.</purpose>
<supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:1,000,000.</supplinf>

<logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using either ESRI SDC Data Development Kit Professional 2 (DDKP2) or tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then loaded into ArcSDE to verify and validate the geometry.</logic>
<complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials. Data completeness generally reflects the content of the original Digital Line Graph (DLG) files.</complete>

<horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was originally extracted from the individual 1:2,000,000-scale State boundary Digital Line Graph (DLG) files produced by the U.S. Geological Survey which have a positional accuracy of 1,720 meters.  It was updated several times using various sources whose horizontal positional accuracies are unknown.</horizpar>

<procdesc>This file was originally digitized by the National Mapping Division based on the sectional maps contained in 'The National Atlas of the United States of America' published by the USGS in 1970. The sectional maps were updated during 1978-1981 and digitized in the early 1980's. The data were updated in 1995 using 1:1,000,000-scale and 1:2,000,000-scale Bureau of Land Management State base maps. These data were published on CD-ROM in 1995. Using ARC/INFO software, the DLG optional format files were converted to ARC/INFO coverages using the DLGARC command. Only linear federal land features and attribute information were extracted for inclusion. The individual State coverages were then merged together using the ARC/INFO command APPEND. The resulting data set was ATLAS-FEDL (Federal Land Features of the U.S. (linear)).

Using ATLAS-FEDL the spatial and attribute data were updated using the Wild and Scenic Rivers web site. The spatial data was aligned with ATLAS-HY (Hydrography Features of the U.S.) and ATLAS-RD (Major roads and trails of the U.S.).

Sudbury, Assabet, and Concord Wild and Scenic Rivers, MA were added using Linear Federal Land Features of the United States 1999, Wild and Scenic Rivers web site, and ATLAS-HY (Hydrography Features of the U.S.) in 2000. The resulting data set was Federal Land Features of the United States - Parkways and Scenic Rivers 2000.

Wilson Creek Wild and Scenic River, NC was added and Baltimore-Washington Parkway, MD and Suitland Parkway, MD were added using Federal Land Features of the United States - Parkways and Scenic Rivers 2000, Wild and Scenic Rivers web site, National Park Guide web site, USGS Geographic Data web site, ATLAS-HY (Hydrography Features of the U.S.), ATLAS-RD (Major roads and trails of the U.S.) in 2001.</procdesc>
