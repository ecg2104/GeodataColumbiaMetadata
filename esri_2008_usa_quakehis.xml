<descript>
<abstract>United States Historic Earthquakes is a point theme representing the locations of significant, historic earthquakes in United States and adjacent Canada and Mexico that caused deaths, property damage, and geological effects, or were otherwise experienced by the resident populations.  Attribute information includes  the depth, maximum magnitude, Modified Mercalli Intensity, location, date and time of the earthquakes. 

This dataset is a part of the 2008 ESRI Data &amp; Maps collection.</abstract>
<purpose>United States Historic Earthquakes provides the locations of significant, historic earthquakes for geographic display and analysis at regional and national levels. This data set is intended for a mixed audience of specialists and non-specialists alike who have a need for general, non-technical information about significant U.S. earthquakes.</purpose>
<supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:1,000,000.</supplinf>

<dataqual>
<attracc>
<attraccr>The attribute table was scanned for unreasonable attribute values of depth and magnitude.</attraccr>
</attracc>
<logic>No formal tests for logical consistency were performed on this data set, principally because the data set contains attribute values that were arrived at by either or both quantitative (i.e. instrumental) and qualitative (i.e. historical) methods.  Earthquakes that occurred prior to the introduction of seismological instrumentation are known only from written records, such as newspapers, books and journals, and diaries, which often may provide contradictory information that has to be carefully examined and weighed.  As seismographs became more common in the early 1960's, the origin time and location were both more precisely and accurately determined but the compilation and evaluation of intensity reports was, and still is, a process that involves considerable subjectivity.  As a result, all attributes associated with a given earthquake should be considered provisional and subject to further revision based on acquisition of new information and use of new analytical methods.

The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using either ESRI SDC Data Development Kit Professional 2 (DDKP2) or tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then loaded into ArcSDE to verify and validate the geometry.</logic>
<complete>This data set contains information on significant, historical earthquakes that caused deaths, property damage, geological effects, or that were experienced by populations in the epicentral area, for the United States, Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Virgin Islands, and adjacent Canada and Mexico.  These data are limited to the best estimates of earthquake locations and to attributes such as magnitude and maximum intensity.

After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>100 meters is the nominal precision of the reported instrumentally located coordinate values but accuracy is considerably less.  Accuracy depends upon numerous factors including imprecision of the velocity model of the earth, uneven distribution of seismic stations, and imprecisions in the computational algorithm.  Following initial proofreading of the input data file, a preliminary map of the locations of the earthquakes was produced which was examined for gross errors in spatial location.</horizpar>
</horizpa>
<vertacc>
<vertaccr>Although depths are reported to the nearest one kilometer, the accuracy for recent earthquakes is considerably less owing to uncertainties in the velocity model of the earth, uneven distribution of seismic stations, and imprecisions in the computational algorithm.</vertaccr>

<procdesc>Data for the years 1568 to 1989, from the Seismicity of the United States, 1568-1989 (Revised) (1993), were combined with the Preliminary Determination of Epicenters (2004) data for 1990 to 2004.  The Earthquake History of the United States (1982) and the Project catalogue and seismic hazard maps, Seismic hazard in Latin America and the Caribbean (1997) were used to compile information for additional locations or for years not covered by the other sources.  The resulting text file was loaded into ArcView and converted to a shapefile.  Three records for Puerto Rico were dropped because they did not include values for longitude and latitude.</procdesc>

<procstep>
<procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the compressed file from the National Atlas of the United States and uncompressed the shapefile (quksigx020.shp).  Removed attributes STATE, DEATHS, and DAMAGE.  Renamed and rearranged the remaining attributes.  Removed features near Guam.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>
