<abstract>This map layer contains mortality information for United States Health Service Areas (805 groups of counties).  Included are mortality rates by sex and race (white and black) for the 11 leading causes of death, 8 subset causes, and all causes combined, for 1988-1992.  Age-adjusted rates are presented along with indicators of whether each rate is considered  reliable and whether it is significantly different from the corresponding U.S. rate.  This is a revised version of the 1998 data set.  This data se was also distributed with the name U.S. Mortality Database.</abstract>
<purpose>These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the  national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  The U.S. Geological Survey assumes no responsibility for the use of these data.</purpose>
<supplinf>This data comes from Pickle L.W., Mungiole M., Jones G.K., White A.A.,  Atlas of United States Mortality.  Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS) Publication. No. (PHS) 97-1015.  Hyattsville, MD: National Center  for Health Statistics, 1996.  Additional information may be obtained from the home page of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, National Center for Health Statistics at: &lt;http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/&gt;.

The user is cautioned not to over-interpret apparent visual correlations between spatial patterns of mortality and environmental and (or)  sociodemographic factors.  In many cases, patterns appear similar because some other unmeasured factor causes both the risk factor and the mortality patterns, not because the risk factor actually causes higher mortality. Users are urged to confirm suspected correlations by a more complete multivariate analysis which includes known risk factors for the disease.</supplinf>

<procdesc>The COUNTYP020 file was read into Arc/INFO as a coverage and modified to reflect the 1990 county boundaries.  The counties were aggregated to  Health Service Areas (HSA's) and fields were added to the coverage for  the HSA name and number.  A new coverage of the Health Service Areas was  created.  The individual data base files (dbf's) from the Atlas of United States Mortality for each cause-of-death were loaded into ArcView and the attribute names were modified so cause-of-death was included. The dbf files were then merged into one large dbf file, with all 19 causes-of-death included.  The dbf was converted to an INFO table which was then joined to the Health Service Areas coverage, and the result was converted to shapefile format.</procdesc>
