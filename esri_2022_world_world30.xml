Each data vendor has its own data licensing policies and may grant varying redistribution rights to end users. Consult the redistribution rights below for this dataset provided on Data and Maps. As used herein, “Geodata” shall mean any digital dataset consisting of geographic data coordinates and associated attributes.

The redistribution rights for this dataset: Redistribution rights are granted by the data vendor for hard-copy renditions or static, electronic map images (e.g. .gif, .jpeg, and so on) that are plotted, printed, or publicly displayed with proper metadata and source/copyright attribution to the respective data vendor(s).

Geodata is redistributable without a Value-Added Software Application (i.e., adding the sample data to an existing, [non]commercial dataset for redistribution) with proper metadata and source/copyright attribution to the respective data vendor(s).

The terms and conditions below apply to all the datasets provided on Data and Maps.

Proprietary Rights and Copyright: Licensee acknowledges that the Data and Related Materials contain proprietary and confidential property of Esri and its licensor(s).
