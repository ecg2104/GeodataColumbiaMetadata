<descript>
<abstract>Geologic Provinces is a polygon theme representing  U.S. Geological Survey defined geologic provinces of the World. Each province has a set of geologic characteristics distinguishing it from surrounding provinces. These characteristics may include the dominant lithologies, the age of the strata, and the structural style. Some provinces include multiple genetically-related basins. Offshore province boundaries are generally defined by the 2000 meter bathymetric contour, but where appropriate are defined by the 4000 meter bathymetric contour. In some cases province boundaries are delineated by political boundaries, as in the case of The United States and Canada, because United States petroleum resources were assessed separately by the U.S. Geological Survey. Provinces are classified as either Priority or Boutique. A priority province is one of 76 non-U.S. geologic provinces defined by the U.S. Geological Survey that together contain 95 percent of the world's non-U.S. known petroleum volume. All priority provinces were analyzed for undiscovered petroleum-resources. A boutique province is a geologic province, other than a priority province, as defined by the U.S. Geological Survey, considered for petroleum-resource assessment. Boutique provinces can be chosen for a variety of geologic, political, technical and geographic reasons. Resource-assessments are conducted by scientists of the U.S Geological Survey's World Petroleum Assessment 2000 by means of a combination of Petroleum System analysis based on available geologic information, and statistical analysis of production and exploration information. Total petroleum systems are defined in provinces considered for assessment analysis. Total petroleum systems are subdivided into Assessment Units. Assessment results from the analysis of assessment units and total petroleum systems are aggregated and allocated to geologic provinces. Summary results are presented as attributes of this coverage.</abstract>
<purpose>This shapefile is intended to delineate geologic provinces of the world used in the preparation of World Petroleum Assessment 2000, and to present summary results of this assessment.</purpose>
<supplinf>For data management purposes the world was divided into eight energy regions corresponding approximately to the economic regions of the world as defined by the U.S. Department of State. Except in the case of the United States, most region and province boundaries are not controlled by the presence of political or administrative boundaries. Geologic province boundaries are determined by World Petroleum Assessment 2000 Regional Coordinators, and others, on the basis of natural geologic entities and may include a dominant geologic structural element or a number of continuous elements. Geologic province boundaries, codes and names defined by the Regional Coordinators are combined into a world-wide coverage. Some province boundaries are adjusted for consistency with boundaries of Total Petroleum Systems.  Summary results of  World Petroleum Assessment 2000 are appended to this shapefile.</supplinf>

<dataqual>
<attracc>
<attraccr>The attribute values have been reviewed. This is a composite coverage composed of geologic provinces defined by Regional Coordinators of the U.S. Geological Survey World Energy Project and others. There have been updates and corrections in spelling of the names of the provinces since they were first published in Open File Report 97-463 (Klett and others, 1997).

The following provinces depicted in this coverage have been updated

3108 Cuoqing Lupola Basin     is now Cuoqing Lunpola Basin
3115 Jungger Basin                  is now Junggar Basin
3159 Yingehai Basin                 is now Yinggehai Basin
3403 Huskan Platform              is now Huksan Platform
3404 Korba Bay Basin              is now Korea Bay Basin
6009 Deseado Province            is now Deseado-Falklands Province
6041 Putomayo-Maranon-Oriente Basin is now Putumayo-Maranon-Oriente Basin
6060 North Malvinas Basin      is now Falklands Plateau
6064 Malvinas Trough              is now Burdwood Bank-North Scotia Ridge

Changes have been reviewed by Regional Coordinators.

Only provinces considered for assessment have summary result data. Resources in provinces within the United States of America are not considered here. Summary result data are reported only for provinces considered in this assessment.

Summary data are aggregated from assessment analysis conducted at the Assessment Unit level.</attraccr>

<logic>Polygon topology is present, each polygon has one unique label point, there are no dangles, polygons are bounded at extent of coverage.</logic>
<complete>Geologic provinces are delineated by U.S. Geological Survey World Energy Project Regional Coordinators and others with an emphasis on the determination of petroleum systems. Methods may vary from one region to another. The coverage is updated. Spelling errors in province names are corrected. In some portions, province boundaries are adjusted to more closely match surface geology, where applicable. Some offshore province boundaries have been adjusted beyond the 2000 meter bathymetric contour to the 4000 meter bathymetric contour to accommodate undiscovered oil or gas fields in deeper waters.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>It is not possible to calculate a definitive measure of the horizontal positional accuracy of this coverage because it is a composite data set compiled from a variety of sources using a variety of methodologies. The maximum possible accuracy is twice fuzzy tolerance of 500 meters, or 1000 meters. Because of the heterogeneous variety of source data, generally of small-scale, used in delineating the province boundaries, there is no datum or spheroid defined. At the average estimated compilation scale of 1:5,000,000, there is not enough geodetic control to define a datum or a spheroid without introducing false precision.</horizpar>
