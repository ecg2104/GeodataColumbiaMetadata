<descript>
<abstract>United States Volcanoes is a polygon theme representing volcanoes thought to be active in the last 10,000 years (Holocene), in and near the United States. The data is a subset of data available from the Global Volcanism Program, Smithsonian Institution.

This dataset is a part of the 2008 ESRI Data &amp; Maps collection.</abstract>
<purpose>United States Volcanoes provides the locations of volcanoes thought to be active in the last 10,000 years for geographic display and analysis at regional and national levels.</purpose>
<supplinf>Largest scale when displaying the data: 1:1,000,000.</supplinf>

<dataqual>
<logic>The shapefile is converted to SDC (Smart Data Compression) format using either ESRI SDC Data Development Kit Professional 2 (DDKP2) or tools in ArcGIS.  The SDC data set is then loaded into ArcSDE to verify and validate the geometry.</logic>
<complete>After processing, the data set is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>The geospatial part of this data set was calculated from latitude/longitude coordinates. The positional accuracy is unknown.

Note that some locations are the center point of broad volcanic fields, and that even at individual volcanoes the coordinates given do not necessarily match the eruption site. Tens of kilometers may separate eruptive centers of a single volcano, particularly in large caldera complexes and rift settings.</horizpar>

<procdesc>The data was downloaded from the Global Volcanism Program Web site.  West longitude and south latitude values were converted to negative values.  The points that are within the geographic extent of the Shorelines for the National Atlas file were extracted. The file was loaded into ArcView and a shapefile was created.</procdesc>

<procdesc>The following steps were performed by ESRI: Downloaded the compressed file from the National Atlas of the United States and uncompressed the shapefile (volcanx020.shp).  Renamed and rearranged the attributes similar to last year.  Removed all features except for those in North and Central America.  Converted the data set to SDC.  Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices.</procdesc>

<attrdef>The volcano number, based on a system developed by the Catalog of Active Volcanoes of the World (CAVW), is in the format ####-##-. The first two numerals identify the region, the next two identify the subregion, and the last two or three (after the hyphen) identify individual volcanoes in that subregion. When there are three final characters and the last character is "=", the number is the same as that found in the CAVW; where the last character is "-", the number is not found in the CAVW because the region was not numbered in the CAVW or has been renumbered for this data set; where the last character is a number, the volcano is in an area included in the CAVW but the number is a new one that does not appear in the CAVW.</attrdef>

<edomv>Shield volcano(es)</edomv>
<edomvd>A volcano that resembles an inverted warrior's shield, with broad, gentle slopes, built by multiple eruptions of fluid basalt lava. Basalt lava tends to build enormous, low-angle cones because it flows across the ground easily and can form lava tubes that enable lava to flow tens of kilometers from an erupting vent with very little cooling.</edomvd>
