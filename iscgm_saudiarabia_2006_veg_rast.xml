			<abstract>Saudi Arabia Vegetation is a raster theme representing percentages of tree cover throughout Saudi Arabia at a resolution of 30 arc seconds.  This layer is a component of the Global Map a 1:1,000,000 scale framework dataset of the world. It consists of vector and raster layers of transport, administrative boundaries, drainage, elevation, vegetation, land use and land cover data. The data were prepared from information provided by national mapping and other organizations worldwide.</abstract>
			<purpose>The concept of Global Mapping, and the establishment of an international body for
Global Mapping, was first proposed by the Ministry of Construction of Japan (MOC) in
1992; and in 1994 the Geographical Survey Institute of Japan (GSI) proposed the first
draft Map Specifications. The project currently involves the participation of many
interested nations.
The main objective of this global project is to bring all nations and concerned
organizations together to develop and provide easy and open access to global digital
geographic information at a scale of 1:1 million. This would be used to facilitate the
implementation of global agreements and conventions for environmental protection,
for monitoring of major environmental phenomena and to encourage economic
growth within the context of sustainable development. As part of this objective, a
Global Map product will be developed to this specification.
The Global Map will also contribute to the development of a Global Spatial Data
Infrastructure.</purpose>

		<logic>Logical consistency is a measure of the degree to which data complies with the technical specification. Logical consistency was validated by tests to check that table and file names are set out as in the Data Dictionary. Graphical tests checking such things as intersections, polygon closure, minimum sizes of polygons and length of linear features were also carried out.</logic>
		<complete>Completeness is a measure of the degree to which all features listed in the technical specification have been captured, in accordance with the selection criteria, definitions and other rules specified. All instances of a feature and its attribute values that meet the selection criteria and appear on the source materials are captured. The data is generalized so the selection of features is to some extent subjective.</complete>

			<horizpa>
				<horizpar>For horizontal accuracy, 90% of points will be within 2km of their actual
location. In the case of data obtained from satellite images, the maximum error
is less than or equal to 0.5km.</horizpar>

			<vertacc>
				<vertaccr>Vertical accuracy is notionally  within 150 meters for 90% of points. This figure may
need to be reviewed once the data are available, as sources to this accuracy
may not be available in areas of high relief.</vertaccr>

				<procdesc>The source data for the raster data layers was supplied by the United States Geological Survey and consisted of the revised Global 30" Elevation dataset (GTOPO30) produced by EROS and data derived from the Global Landcover Characteristics Database (CLCCD), a cooperative venture between USGS, the University of Nebraska-Lincoln and the European Commission's Joint Research Centre (JRC). The land cover, land use and vegetation layers were edited by AUSLIG to reflect some errors of classification. However, it was not subjected to a thorough vetting.</procdesc>
