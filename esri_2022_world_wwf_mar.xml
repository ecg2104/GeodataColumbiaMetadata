<abstract>World Wildlife Fund Marine Ecoregions, 2022 is a polygon theme that represents global marine ecoregions. Ecoregions are defined as relatively large areas of land or water in the world containing a characteristic set of natural communities that share a large majority of their species, dynamics, and environmental conditions. This data set contains the marine ecoregions of the Global 200. Global 200 ecoregions are a collection of the Earth's most outstanding and diverse terrestrial, freshwater, and marine habitats where the Earth's biological wealth is most distinctive and rich, where its loss will be most severely felt, and we must protect if we are to preserve the web of life. For more information, contact https://www.worldwildlife.org.</abstract>
<purpose>World Wildlife Fund Marine Ecoregions provides a global view of marine ecoregions defined by the World Wildlife Fund Conservation Science Program 2001, and can be used for geographic display.</purpose>

<procdesc>We began by accepting the biogeographic realms of Pielou (1979) and Udvardy (1975) and modifying the biome systems of Dinerstein et al. (1995) and Ricketts et al. (1999). We then consulted existing global maps of floristic or zoogeographic provinces, global and regional maps of units based on the distribution of selected groups of plants and animals, the world's biotic province maps, and global maps of broad vegetation types. These were useful for evaluating the extent of realms and biomes, the first two tiers in our hierarchical classification. We then identified published regional classification systems to be used as a baseline for ecoregion boundaries. Data and consultations from regional experts were also important for final ecoregion delineations.</procdesc>

<procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Downloaded the data set from World Wildlife Fund's FTP site. Removed excess attributes. Adjusted order of attributes. Made field names match World Wildlife Fund Terrestrial Ecoregions'. Renamed the data set. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr), projection file (.prj), and spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
