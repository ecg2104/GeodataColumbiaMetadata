<abstract>This map layer portrays 1988 estimates for total personal income, per capita personal income, annual number of full-time and part-time jobs, average wage per job in dollars, population, and per capita number of jobs, for counties in the United States.

Total personal income is all the income that is received by, or on behalf of, the residents of a particular area.  It is calculated as the sum of wage and salary disbursements, other labor income, proprietors' income with inventory valuation and capital consumption adjustments, rental income of persons with capital consumption adjustment, personal dividend income, personal interest income, and transfer payments to persons, minus personal contributions for social insurance.

Per capita personal income is calculated as the total personal income of the residents of a county divided by the resident population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation.

The average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs includes all jobs for which wages and salaries are paid, except jury and witness service and paid employment of prisoners.  The jobs are counted at equal weight, and employees, sole proprietors, and active partners are all included.  Unpaid family workers and volunteers are not included.

Average wage per job is the total wage and salary disbursements divided by the number of wage and salary jobs in the county.  Wage and salary disbursements consist of the monetary remuneration of employees, including the compensation of corporate officers; commissions, tips, and bonuses;and receipts in kind, or pay-in-kind, such as the meals furnished to the employees of restaurants.  It reflects the amount of payments disbursed,but not necessarily earned during the year.

Per capita number of jobs is calculated as the average annual number of full-time and part-time jobs in a county divided by the resident population of the county.  The Census Bureau's annual midyear population estimates were used in the computation.

All dollar estimates are in current dollars, not adjusted for inflation.The information in this map layer comes from the Regional Economic Information System (REIS) that is distributed by the Bureau of Economic Analysis, http://www.bea.gov/.

This is an updated version of the November 2004 map layer.</abstract>
<purpose>These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data. No responsibility is assumed by the National Atlas of the United States in the use of these data.</purpose>

<procdesc>Boundaries for Puerto Rico, the U.S. Virgin Islands, and the water
        bodies were deleted from ATLAS-1990CNTY.  Using information from the
        file CA13FN.TXT on BEA-REIS2004, the following counties were adjusted to
        reflect the boundaries in effect IN 1988:
        &gt; Cibola County merged into Valencia County, New Mexico
        &gt; La Paz County merged into Yuma County, Arizona
        &gt; Menominee County merged into Shawano County, Wisconsin

        &gt;     Aleutians Islands Census Area, Alaska
        &gt; Yellowstone National Park merged into Park and Gallatin counties,
        &gt;     Montana
        The information in the file ECONLIST.PRN on BEA-REIS2004 was used to
        merge the following counties and cities in Virginia:

        were extracted and joined to the edited ATLAS-1990CNTY map layer.  The
