<abstract>United States Weigh in Motion (WIM), 2008 is a point theme representing weigh in motion faciliies in the United States.  The data included in the GIS Traffic Stations Version database have been assimilated from station description files provided by FHWA for Weigh-in-Motion (WIM), and Automatic Traffic Counters (ATR). Location referencing information was derived from the National Highway Planning Network version 4.0.  and State offices of Transportation

The attributes on the point elements of the database have come from two primary sources, the Station Description Records and the National Highway Planning Network's Linear Referencing System. The attributes for these databases have been intentionally limited to location referencing attributes since the core station description attribute data are contained within the Station Description Tables (SDT). 

There is a separate Station Description Table (SDT) for each of the different station types; WIM, and ATR. The attributes in the Station Description Table correspond with the Station Description Record found in Chapter 6 of the latest Traffic Monitoring Guide. The SDT contains the most recent stations available for each state and station type. This table was derived from files provided UTCTR by FHWA. The Station Description Table can be linked to the station shapefile via the STNNKEY field . 

A single exception table containing records for those stations that could not be located is provided for WIM, and ATR stations. Generally, this table contains records where location descriptions were not clear enough to locate a station. It is hoped that FHWA will be able to contact the States for a more detailed description</abstract>
<purpose>The GIS Traffic Stations database provides structural linkages between the National Highway Planning Network Weigh In Motion (WIM), and Automatic Traffic Count Stations (ATR)</purpose>

<attraccr>Attribute information for Weigh in Motion (WIM) sites was processed separately from the effort to spatially locate these sites.  The attribute information for all WIM sites in the US was provided in an excel spreadsheet by the FHWA to RITA.  The FHWA collects WIM data from the State Departments of Transportation (DOT) on a monthly basis.

Weigh Station attributes were obtained from the individual State DOTs, University of Tennessee data, National Highway Planning Network, Federal Highway Administration, and RITA (Research and Innovative Technology Administration). All records were assigned the accurate state name, state abbreviation, state FIPS code and county FIPS code.</attraccr>

<srccitea>WIM Station Attribute</srccitea>
<srccontr>WIM site information, as reported by State DOTs to the FHWA, may consist of multiple data collecting stations for a single site, each identified by a unique identifier (ID).  WIM sites can be considered a complex of stations that make up the site.  Multiple stations can be grouped together or associated to a single site through the ID.  Common reasons for multiple stations for a single site are that each station represents a different direction or travel for that location, or multiple roads (sometimes each road will be a different Functional Classification) intersecting the site's location.  Where multiple stations existed, for a given WIM site, FHWA summarized these to one station for the data it provide to RITA. This data was submitted to RITA, from the FHWA, in an excel spreadsheet.</srccontr>
</srcinfo>
<procstep>
<procdesc>The station location description for each station type WIM, ATR, and Classification was used to manually adjust a station to the National Highway Planning Network (NHPN) v4.0. Any stations that could not be located on the NHPN were located on TIGER 99. Any stations that could not be located due to poor location descriptions are contained in the exception data table delivered with the GIS Traffic Stations.</procdesc>

<procdesc>Weigh Station collection began with FHWA delivering all new weigh station points ot RITA.  Also acquried was the older University of Tennessee dataset to use as a comparison with new FHWA data.  Analysis of data began by comparing the two datasets.  All duplicate points were elimitnated from the new FHWA dataset.  Once a final dataset was complete, a state-by-state analysis began.  As each state's database was populated differently, analysis varied from state to state.  
Process steps included indentifying county code per point. Determine broad location of road segment using LRS Id.  Value could then be tied into the LRSKEY value on road segments.
If no LRS ID was provided, HPMS values were also used to determine location.
Finally, an exact point was determined by using the provided text description within the location field.
Once exact location was determined, edit session was begun and the point was manually created.
After all points were populated, the latitude and longitude fields were calculated using a script in an edit session.
The resulting dataset was then made into a shapefile.</procdesc>

<procdesc>The attribute data for each WIM site consisted of 13 records.  Each record represented a different vehicle classification.  A volume count and average weight, where appropriate, was recorded for each vehicle classification for that site.  These data were further categorized by State, and by year the data was submitted to the FHWA. The processing of the data was straight forward; summarize the 13 records for a given site to a single record and join this record to the existing spatial database of WIM sites.  This was accomplished with the following process steps:
Step 1 - Where multiple stations existed for a single site, FHWA distilled these to a single station for that site (each station has 13 records representing a different vehicle classification).  In some cases, not all stations for a site were captured by the FHWA before the data was delivered to RITA.  In these cases RITA had to conduct special processing to distill these to a single station for the site.  
Step 2 - In general, each site had 13 records.  Each record represented a different classification of vehicle.  Each record had a vehicle volume count for that classification and what percentage of the total volume it represented.  Vehicle classes 1- 4 were passenger vehicles (i.e. cars), and classes 5 - 13 were trucks.  This last group had average weight recorded when available. These 13 records were summarized to one record for the site.  This processes consisted of separating truck and passenger vehicle volumes into different fields for the representative record of all vehicle classifications for that site.  Truck and passenger volumes for the site were added together to obtain its total vehicle volume.  All of the average gross vehicle weights were summarized.  Total trucks were divided by total vehicle volume to obtain percent truck.  This was added to the database.  Truck volume was deleted from the database.  
Step 4 - The processed attribute record for the WIM site was joined to the spatial data.  Redundant fields were deleted.</procdesc>
