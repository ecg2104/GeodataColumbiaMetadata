<dataqual>
<logic>The dataset is converted to file geodatabase (FGDB) format using tools in ArcGIS. The geometry is checked, and if needed repaired.</logic>
<complete>After processing, the dataset is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.

This map layer contains water bodies of the United States and Puerto Rico. Only water bodies appropriate for a 1:1,000,000- scale data set are included. Water bodies smaller than one square kilometer are excluded unless one of the following applies: they are in the National Atlas 1:2,000,000-scale map layer, they are in other small- scale data sets or maps, they cover a small coastal island, they have been merged with a larger feature, or their size has been reduced during alignment with other 1:1,000,000-scale map layers.

Swamps and marshes may be underrepresented in some areas. In the southeastern U.S., some swamp/marsh limits were difficult to determine due to unclear or conflicting information in imagery, topographical maps, and landcover. In Alaska, swamps and marshes appear to be underrepresented when compared to landcover data sets and topographical maps. Water bodies may also be underrepresented in areas that contain large numbers of small isolated features which were too far apart to aggregate and too small to be included by themselves.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>Water bodies are in approximately the same locations as in the NHD 100K water bodies data used as a source. However, many processes and editing tasks resulted in the movement of water body limits from their original positions, including: generalizing and aggregating water bodies, modifying water bodies to meet minimum width standards, moving water body limits 300 meters from transportation features if the two were parallel, extending or trimming water bodies to intersect coastlines or international boundaries, increasing or decreasing the gap between neighboring water bodies, adjusting water bodies to fit the streams that flow through them, and modifying water bodies to match imagery.

Horizontal positions are specified in geographic coordinates in decimal degrees. Latitudes are given to the nearest 0.000150. Longitudes are given to the nearest 0.000150. The positional accuracy is unknown.</horizpar>
