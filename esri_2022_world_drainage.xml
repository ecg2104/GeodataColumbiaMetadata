Each data vendor has its own data licensing policies and may grant varying redistribution rights to end users. Consult the redistribution rights below for this dataset provided on Data and Maps. As used herein, “Geodata” shall mean any digital dataset consisting of geographic data coordinates and associated attributes.

The redistribution rights for this dataset: Redistribution rights are granted by the data vendor for hard-copy renditions or static, electronic map images (e.g. .gif, .jpeg, and so on) that are plotted, printed, or publicly displayed with proper metadata and source/copyright attribution to the respective data vendor(s). Geodata is redistributable with a Value-Added Software Application developed by Esri Business Partners on a royalty-free basis with proper metadata and source/copyright attribution to the respective data vendor(s). Geodata is redistributable without a Value-Added Software Application (i.e., adding the sample data to an existing, [non]commercial dataset for redistribution) with proper metadata and source/copyright attribution to the respective data vendor(s).

The terms and conditions below apply to all the datasets provided on Data and Maps.

Proprietary Rights and Copyright: Licensee acknowledges that the Data and Related Materials contain proprietary and confidential property of Esri and its licensor(s).

<procstep>
<procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the features from ArcWorld 1:25M. Aligned the mouths of rivers with coastlines. Made features consistent with all political boundaries they are coincident with. Added attribute values from the Rand McNally New International Atlas, the Times Atlas of the World, the Digital Chart of the World, and World Resources Institute. Added St. Lawrence system from ArcWorld 1:3M. Generalized to match detail of the Cntry00.shp. Removed unneeded attributes. Created ArcGIS layer file (.lyr). Created projection file (.prj). Ran ArcView GIS Avenue™ request ExportClean, and created spatial indices. Converted the data set to SDC.</procdesc>
