<abstract>U.S. Census Urban Areas represents the 2010 Census urban areas in the United States. An urban area comprises a densely settled core of census tracts and/or census blocks that meet minimum population density requirements, along with adjacent territory containing non-residential urban land uses as well as territory with low population density included to link outlying densely settled territory with the densely settled core. To qualify as an urban area, the territory identified according to criteria must encompass at least 2,500 people, at least 1,500 of which reside outside institutional group quarters. The U.S. Census Bureau identifies two types of urban areas—Urbanized Areas (UA) of 50,000 or more people and Urban Clusters (UC) of at least 2,500 and less than 50,000 people. The U.S. Census Bureau delineates urban areas that represent densely developed territory, encompassing residential, commercial, and other non-residential urban land uses. In general, this territory consists of areas of high population density and urban land use resulting in a representation of the "urban footprint."</abstract>
<purpose>U.S. Census Urban Areas provides information about the locations, names, population, and codes of urban areas primarily for national planning applications.</purpose>

<dataqual>
<logic>The dataset is converted to file geodatabase (FGDB) format using tools in ArcGIS. The geometry is checked, and if needed repaired.</logic>
<complete>After processing, the dataset is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>The positional accuracy varies with the source materials used. The Census Bureau cannot specify the positional accuracy of feature changes added by its field staff through local updates or of features derived from the GBF/DIME-Files or other map or digital sources. Thus, the level of positional accuracy in the TIGER/Line datasets makes them unsuitable for high-precision measurement applications such as engineering problems, property transfers, or other uses that might require highly accurate measurements of the earth's surface. The horizontal positional accuracy is unknown.</horizpar>

<procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Downloaded the geodatabase tlgdb_2013_a_us_nationgeo.gdb source from the U.S. Census: https://www.census.gov/geo/maps-data/data/tiger-geodatabases.html. Added the field UA_ID and calculated its values from the source field GEOID. Added the fields NAME and LSAD_DESC and calculated their values based on the source field NAMELSAD. Added the field LSAD and calculated its values from referencing the source field UATYP. Attached the fields POP2010, POP10_SQMI, HSE_UNITS, and SQMI from Data &amp; Maps 2013 U.S. Census Urbanized Areas. Recalculated the field SQMI with its values projected to North America Equidistant Conic. Recalculated the field POP10_SQMI using SQMI. Put "-99" values into the fields POP2010, POP10_SQMI, and HSE_UNITS for records where there were no matches.</procdesc>
