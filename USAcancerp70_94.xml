<abstract>This data set contains 1970-1994 cancer mortality information for counties in the United States.  Included are death rates, number of deaths, confidence levels, and expected number of deaths for white males and white  females for 20 cancers.  The data are from a cancer mapping project in the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) Division of Cancer Epidemiology and Genetics (DCEG).</abstract>
<purpose>These data are intended for geographic display and analysis at the national level, and for large regional areas.  The data should be displayed and analyzed at scales appropriate for 1:2,000,000-scale data.  No responsibility is assumed by the U.S. Geological Survey in the use of these data.</purpose>
<supplinf>These data come from Devesa, S.S., D.J. Grauman, W.J. Blot, G.A. Pennello, R.N. Hoover, J.F. Fraumeni, Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United States, 1950-94.  National Institutes of Health (NIH) Publication. No  (PHS) 99-4564. Bethesda, MD: National Cancer Institute, September 1999. Additional information may be obtained from the home page of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, National Institutes of Health, National Cancer Institute, at &lt;http://cancer.gov/&gt;.</supplinf>

It is the death rate excluding areas considered unstable by the National Cancer Institute.  The rates are for ccorpus uteri and uterus not otherwise specified cancer per 100,000 population for females.  The numbers are age-adjusted to the 1970 U.S. population.  An area was considered unstable if (a) the observed number of deaths was less than 6; (b) the observed number of deaths was less than 12 and the rate was not significantly different statistically from the U.S. rate; or (c) the expected number of deaths was less than 6 and the rate was not significantly different statistically from the U.S. rate.</attrdef>

<procdesc>Several counties and independent cities in Montana, New York, Virginia, 
         and Wisconsin from the National Atlas 1980 county dataset, COUNTY1980, 
         were merged into adjacent counties to form the NCI units. The Arc/INFO 
         Dissolve command was used to perform the merging of counties.  Polygons 
         for Puerto Rico, U.S. Virgin Islands, and the Great Lakes were deleted.
         
         The white male and white female, county-based cancer database files, 
         CANCER, were downloaded from
         &lt;http://www3.cancer.gov/atlasplus/download.html&gt;.  An additional file, 
         SPARSE_DATA, drawn from the Atlas of Cancer Mortality in the United 
         States, 1950-94, and containing cancer rates for mapping purposes was 
         received via electronic mail.  The field names in the database files 
         were changed to create unique names, and the files were merged into a 
         single database file.  The database file was joined to the spatial 
         dataset described above.</procdesc>
