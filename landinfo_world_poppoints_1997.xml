			<abstract>World Miscellaneous Population Points is a point theme representing population centers worldwide.  Features in this layer have an FACC (Feature and Attribute Coding Catalogue) Code of AI030, defined as, "camp", or AK 160, "Stadium/Amphitheatre", or AL015,  "Building", or AL025 "Cairn", or AL105 "Settlement", or AL130, "Monument", or AL135, "Native Settlement", or AL200, "Ruins", or AL260, "Wall", or BC050,  "Lighthouse", or Suool, "Military Base."  This dataset is part of the Vector Map Level 0 database. The Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database represents the third edition of the Digital Chart of the World. VMap Level 0 is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data stored on compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM). The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The data includes major road and rail networks, major hydrologic drainage systems, major utility networks (cross-country pipelines and communication lines), all major airports, elevation contours (1000 foot(ft), with 500ft and 250ft supplemental contours), coastlines, international boundaries and populated places.</abstract>
			<purpose>The VMap Level 0 is a general purpose global database designed to support designed to support Geographic Information Systems applications. Geographic Information Systems applications.</purpose>
			<supplinf>The following conversion was implemented to classify area population features from Digital Chart of the World, edition 1, July 1992.
1) DCW point populated places and villages were converted to point settlements (AL105). The name of the city has been placed in the Text attribute (TXT).
2) DCW point "kampongs" and circular villages were converted to native settlement (AL135).</supplinf>

No undershoots or overshoots are present. All data were consistently captured using the rules described in the narrative associated with the Data Quality Table and in the various feature table narrative files present at the coverage level within the library.</logic>

			<horizpa>
				<horizpar>The Horizontal Positional Accuracy Value represents overall accuracy. Source chart-specific accuracies are available as area feature attributes in the VMap-0 data quality coverage. The primary accuracy analysis was performed on one chart only in the prototyping phase of the DCW project. Horizontal Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters. Detailed horizontal accuracy figures were developed by comparing the positions of well-defined points in the roads, railroads, utility lines, and drainage coverages against sources of higher accuracy, measuring the offsets, and expressing differences as a Circular Map Accuracy figure at a 90% confidence interval. This figure was independently verified by adding known production errors to source chart accuracies in a root sum square calculation.</horizpar>

			<vertacc>
				<vertaccr>This figure represents overall accuracy. Source chart-specific accuracies are available as area feature attributes in the V-Map 0 data quality coverage. Vertical Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters. Vertical accuracy figures were developed by comparing elevation contour locations on 1:24,000 scale maps to elevation values at the same location within the digital database. Some manual interpolation was necessary to complete this test. The analysis results are expressed as linear error at a 90% confidence interval.</vertaccr>

				<procdesc>For the first edition DCW, stable-based positives were produced from the original reproduction negatives (up to 35 per ONC sheet). These were digitized either through a scanning-raster to vector conversion or hand digitized into vector form. The vector data was then tagged with attribute information using ARC-INFO software. Transformation to geographic coordinates was performed using the projection graticules for each sheet. Digital information was edge matched between sheets to create large regional datasets. These were then subdivided into 5 x 5 degree tiles and converted from ARC/INFO to VPF. The data was then pre-mastered for CD-ROM. QC was performed by a separate group for each step in the production process.</procdesc>
