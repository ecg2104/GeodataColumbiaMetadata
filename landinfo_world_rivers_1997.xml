<abstract>Smaller Rivers &amp; Streams is a line theme representing inland water feature throughout the world.  This layer was crated as a part of the VMap Level 0 Database.  The Vector Map (VMap) Level 0 database represents the third edition of the Digital Chart of the World. VMap Level 0 is a comprehensive 1:1,000,000 scale vector of the world. It consists of cartographic, attribute, and textual data stored on compact disc read only memory (CD-ROM). The primary source for the database is the National Imagery and Mapping Agency's (NIMA) Operational Navigation Chart (ONC) series. This is the largest scale unclassified map series in existence that provides consistent, continuous global coverage of essential basemap features. The data includes major road and rail networks, major hydrologic drainage systems, major utility networks (cross-country pipelines and communication lines), all major airports, elevation contours (1000 foot(ft), with 500ft and 250ft supplemental contours), coastlines, international boundaries and populated places.</abstract>
<purpose>The VMap Level 0 is a general purpose global database designed to support Geographic Information Systems applications.

<horizpar>The Horizontal Positional Accuracy Value represents overall
        accuracy. Source chart-specific accuracies are available as
        area feature attributes in the VMap-0 data quality
        coverage. The primary accuracy analysis was performed on
        one chart only in the prototyping phase of the DCW project.
        Horizontal Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters.
        Detailed horizontal accuracy figures were developed by
        comparing the positions of well-defined points in the
        roads, railroads, utility lines, and drainage coverages
        against sources of higher accuracy, measuring the offsets,
        and expressing differences as a Circular Map Accuracy
        figure at a 90% confidence interval. This figure was
        independently verified by adding known production errors to
        source chart accuracies in a root sum square calculation.</horizpar>

<vertacc>
<vertaccr>This figure represents overall accuracy. Source
        chart-specific accuracies are available as area feature
        attributes in the V-Map 0 data quality coverage.
        Vertical Positional Accuracy is expressed in meters.
        Vertical accuracy figures were developed by comparing
        elevation contour locations on 1:24,000 scale maps to
        elevation values at the same location within the digital
        database. Some manual interpolation was necessary to
        complete this test. The analysis results are expressed as
        linear error at a 90% confidence interval.</vertaccr>

<overview>
<eaover>The DCW used a product-specific attribute coding system
      that is composed of TYPE and STATUS designators for area,
      line, and point features; and LEVEL and SYMBOL designators
      for text features. The TYPE attribute specifies what the
      feature is, while the STATUS attribute specifies the
      current condition of the feature. Some features require
      both a TYPE and STATUS code to uniquely identify their
      characteristics. In order to uniquely identify each
      geographic attribute in the DCW, the TYPE and STATUS
      attribute code names are preceded by the two letter
      coverage abbreviation and a two letter abbreviation for the
      type of graphic primitive present. VMap-0 data is attribute
      coded in accordance with Feature and Attribute Coding
      Catalog (FACC). The DCW Type/Status codes were mapped into
      the FACC coding scheme. A full description of FACC may be
      found in Digital Geographic Information Exchange Standard
      Edition 1.2, January 1994.</eaover>
<eadetcit>Entities (features) and Attributes for DCW are fully
      described in: Department of Defense, 1992, Military
      Specification Digital Chart of the World (MIL-D-89009):
      Philadelphia, Department of Defense, Defense Printing
      Service Detachment Office. VMap-0 is described in:
      Department of Defense, Military Specification, Vector Map
      (VMap) Level 0 (MIL-V-89039), 9 Feb 1995.</eadetcit>
