<descript>
<abstract>World Rivers and Streams, 2022 is a line theme that represents the rivers, streams, and canals of the world. These rivers, streams, and canals are too narrow to be represented as polygons.For complete hydrographic coverage, use this dataset in conjunction with the World Water Bodies dataset.</abstract>
<purpose>World Linear Water provides a detailed basemap layer for the rivers, streams, and canals of the world.</purpose>

<logic>The dataset is converted to file geodatabase (FGDB) format using tools in ArcGIS. The geometry is checked, and if needed repaired.</logic>
<complete>After processing, the dataset is checked for drawing display and number of records and file sizes compared with source materials.</complete>
<posacc>
<horizpa>
<horizpar>The World Base Map was derived using Landsat 8, Landsat 7 (Global Land Survey (GLS) 2000 and GLS 2005), and SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topography Mission) as a global base. Landsat 7 provided the horizontal positional accuracy of ± 50 meters 90% circular error, and SRTM ensured that features appropriately fit the topography (such as rivers flowed through valleys).</horizpar>

<procstep>
<procdesc>The following steps were performed by Esri: Extracted the file geodatabase (.gdb) feature class from the subset of World Base Map. Dissolved on the source fields ISO_CC, DFCC_DESCRIPTION, and NAME1 to reduce the number of features. Added the field NAME and calculated its values to the source field NAME1. Added the field TYPE and calculated its values using the source DFCC code and description fields. Deleted all fields except NAME, TYPE, and ISO_CC.</procdesc>
