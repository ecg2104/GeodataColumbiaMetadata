Values in this database's X and Y Coordinate fields correspond to the New York-Long Island
State Plane Coordinate system and are derived from the centroids of the tax lots in the Tax Lot
Base Map Files. Facility symbols can be mapped using these fields with both Tax Block and
Tax Lot and the Administrative and Political District Base Map Files.

Approximately 2,300 records in this database that contain information on certain types of
parkland properties (including transportation-related open spaces, former street properties,
waterfront, or land under water) are not coded with tax block and tax lot numbers. The values
in these records X and Y coordinate fields are derived from a GIS layer of open space from the
Department of Parks and Recreation. In addition, the four records for Hudson River Park are
not coded with tax block and tax lot numbers. The values in the X and Y coordinate fields of
these four records are derived from the approximate center points of the four respective
sections. Certain parkland properties which are located on multiple tax lots or multiple parcels
not coded with tax lots are listed as multiple records in the database with multiple X and Y
coordinates.</procdesc>
